# conflaunch

A cross-platform, hackable GUI config launcher for you to stop mashing the up arrow.

---

## What is this?

This script is very simple â€“ you have buttons to easily access your configs of choice, without the need to search for them or frustratingly mash the up arrow in your terminal. You can hack and fork it to your needs with ease, for example add custom config paths or other features.

---

## Install

To install, simply run this command in your terminal:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neuralcurtis/conflaunch/main/install-launcher.sh)"
```
The script will automatically install conflaunch and all the dependencies needed for your system and add it to your apps menu.
Note: as of now, only **Debian**, **Fedora** and **Arch** based distros are supported. You will need to add the file paths manually.
